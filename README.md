🔧 Backend: Built with hashtag#Django for a robust and scalable server-side framework.

🌐 Frontend: Powered by React and Vite, offering a seamless and responsive user experience.

🗺️ Geospatial Analysis: Utilizes Google Earth Engine for detailed land cover data and Shapely for advanced geographic analysis and buffering.

🌍 Mapping: Features interactive maps with Leaflet and GeoJSON to visualize and explore data effectively.

🔍 Data Collection: Employs Selenium for efficient web scraping from sources like Booking and Google Maps, gathering essential information on hotels, restaurants, parks, and hospitals.

🔐 Authentication: Implements JWT for secure and reliable user authentication.

📊 Data Management: Cleansed data is stored in SQL files, imported into a Django-managed database for streamlined access and management.

This SaaS solution aims to simplify the decision-making process for investors and developers by providing detailed, data-driven insights into suitable areas for hotel construction.
